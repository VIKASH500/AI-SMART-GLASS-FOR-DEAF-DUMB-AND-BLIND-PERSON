Our objectives are diverse and cater to specific challenges faced by different user groups. For the **deaf**, the goal is to enhance real-time communication by providing **subtitles through AI smart glasses**. **Non-verbal individuals** benefit from sign language recognition, converting **signs into audio for seamless interaction**. **Blind individuals** experience an enriched environment perception through AI smart glasses, fostering independence and interaction through **voice commands**. In the realm of healthcare and fitness, our Smart Watch offers customization through AR and VR, providing real-time accuracy and personalized experiences.

Our proposed solution involves the development of specialized AI smart glasses and a Smart Watch. For the deaf, live subtitles are generated using **Advanced Speech-to-Text Algorithms**. Non-verbal individuals benefit from **Sign language recognition and audio conversion**. Blind individuals receive an augmented perception of their surroundings through **AR, VR, ML and DL** technologies. The **Smart Watch** leverages **AR and VR** for **Real-Time customization**, focusing on fitness and healthcare accuracy.
